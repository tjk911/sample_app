# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for
the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

# Kai notes

Made some slight tweaks, running Foundation instead of Bootstrap

Tweaked to use Foundation-will_paginate instead, and user spec set to select for UL instead of DIV.

# To do

~~1. Figure out a cleaner way to implement the Foundation js files.~~

~~2. Update authorization (Chapt 9.2)~~

~~3. Start partial refactoring (Chapt 9.3.4)~~

4. Figure out method to toggle admin status independently
5. Figure out error on undefined method "update_attributes" for delete signout_path
6. Start on proto feed (10.3.3)
